    <h2>Olivia</h2>
    <p><font size="+1">Hi everyone, I'm Olivia. I just came to the state 6 months ago, and I love being here to study. But the weather is awful because I am from Taiwan which is a warm and humid island. So I'd never seen snow before I came here haha. I love snow at begging I think it is beautiful, but now I hate walking on the iced road.</font></p> 
    <h3>Major</h3>
    <p><font size="+1">My major is accounting. I want to be an accountant in the future because being an accountant I can work at home and take care of my kids at the same time.</font></p>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p><font size="+1">When I have free time, I like to invite friends to come to my house to have dinner because I LOVE cooking a lot. I enjoy cooking for my husband and my friends. I love Taiwanese food very much. Dumplings, fried noodles, rice, all kinds of soup, etc. Basically, I love all kinds of Asian food. Also, I like to exercise especially I like to play basketball. That is kind of how I and my husband started getting to know each other. So my husband served my ward in Taiwan and at that time we played basketball a lot because playing basketball was one of our YSA activities. Anyway, I like playing basketball. That's all about me:) </font></p>
