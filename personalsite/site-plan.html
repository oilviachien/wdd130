      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Simple Structure of Home page: I will show my audience what kind of food our website will provide. I put three categories rice, noodles, and snakes. And I will put pictures for each country with correlated food categories. For example, I will put Taiwanese, Japanese, and Korean rice dishes’ pictures in the rice section, and so does noodles and snakes. (I will put my wireframe down the page, that would be easier to understand.) I would like to put the link in each picture on this page so that if my audiences are interested in any of them they can click it and find the recipe. Also, I think for a food recipe website, putting a lot of pictures would be more attractive.

      <h3>Taiwanese Food</h3>
      <p>
        For this page, I would like to have the dishes’ names, ingredients, and a video to show people how to make them. I would like to have a main meal (ex, rice and noodles), and snakes section. I will put pictures and YouTube videos to let my audiences have clear steps of how to make that food. So my audiences can follow the videos to make their meals.

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        I want to add the link to each pictures in the home page. Therefore, when people click the food that they are interested they can find the page directly.
